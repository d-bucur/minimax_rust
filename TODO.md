# High level
- Implement abstract minimax AI for turn based board game
- Example implementations for tictactoe, connect4 and later chess
- Frontend using Bevy
- Unit testing for game rules and minimax solutions
- Performance focused: implement benchmarks to measure performance gains (criterion + iai + CI)
- secondary frontend: export to wasm and hook up to javascript game

# Steps
- ~~minimax base on tictactoe~~
- parameters for age and best chance of winning
- setup iai
- cache
- connect4 working
- symmetry optimization on cache
- alfa beta pruning
- monte carlo tree search?
